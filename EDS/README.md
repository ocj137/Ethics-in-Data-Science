# Ethics-in-Data-Science --> Ethical-Computing

Here are initial thoughts on ethics in data science and why I started this meetup
as well as a presentation I did at Metis-SF. 


Since I have started this project, I have become convinced that we need to look at
a larger frame than just data science. Hence, I have changed the name of the Meetup group
to Ethical Computing  to reflect that larger perspective.

--------------------

Now, a year plus into this meetup, I am less sanguine that much can be improved from within. 
It seems to  me that the present computer business model, the survaillance economy, cannot be
'improved' from within, as I had hope before! 

At this point, the only we to proceed forward is to abolish this model. This will require both
a technical modification, as well as a social one.

Technically, a possible solution might be implementing blockchain as way to insure privacy
of data, as well as more transperancy of the transactions of data transactions. 

Socially, it seems to me that we cannot bring ourselves to allow this widely used techonology to be owned privately. 
This widely used and needed resource needs to be governed in a public fashion. The question becomes then, how?

Several possibilities come to mind:  as a heavily regulated private utility, like PG&E; a public utility; or as a commonly owned
collective entity. Oh, we can also let it continue as now....

The present status quo, or the private utility model do not seem that appealing. We would just continue in the miserable path we are on now :(
More interesting is to discuss the differences between public utility or commonly owned collective.
