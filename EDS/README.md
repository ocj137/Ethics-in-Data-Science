# Ethics-in-Data-Science

Here are initial thoughts on ethics in data science and why I started this meetup
as well as a presentation I did at Metis-SF. 


Since I have started this project, I have become convinced that we need to look at
a larger frame than just data science. Hence, I have changed the name of the Meetup group
to Ethical Computing  to reflect that larger perspective.
